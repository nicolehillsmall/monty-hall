#' @title 
#' Create a new Monty Hall Problem game.
#'
#' @description
#' `create_game()` generates a new game that consists of two doors
#' with goats behind them, and one with a car.
#'
#' @details
#' The game setup replicates the game on the TV show "Let's Make a Deal" where there are three doors for a contestant 
#' to choose from, one of which has a car behind it and two have goats. The contestant selects a door, then the host 
#' opens a door to reveal a goat, and then the contestant is given an opportunity to stay with their original selection
#' or switch to the other unopened door. There was a famous debate about whether it was optimal to stay or switch when
#' given the option to switch, so this simulation was created to test both strategies.
#'
#' @param
#' No arguments are used by the function.
#'
#' @return 
#' The function returns a length 3 character vector indicating the positions of goats and the car, 'a.game'.
#'
#' @examples

create_game <- function()
{
  a.game <- sample( x=c( "goat","goat","car" ), size=3, replace=F )
  return( a.game )
}
